# GOMI
Branch delete tool made by Golang
## About
GOMI is a tool for deleting merged branches in local git repository.

When you write code with git or github flow,
there are many branches that are already merged into master / develop branch.

You can delete branches merged into your current branch only with

```bash
gomi
```

at your project.
## How to install
You can install via homebrew

```bash
brew tap jiko21/gomi
```

then,

```bash
brew install gomi
```
